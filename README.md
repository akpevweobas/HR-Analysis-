The HR Employee Attrition Analysis delves into the factors influencing employee turnover, retention rate within the company, providing valuable insights to enhance retention strategies and promotes a healthier workplace environment.

## DESCRIPTION
The dataset used in this analysis was obtained from MeriSKILL during my internship. The dataset contained 35 columns and 1470 rows. I worked with SQL for detailed analysis and manipulation, followed by Exploratory Data Analysis and PowerBi for visualizations

## KPIs. 
1. Total Number of Employees: 4410
2. Total Attritions: 711
3. Total Retained Employees: 3699
4. Attrition Rate: 16.12%

## INSIGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
  1.	Looking at the Total Attritions, Marital Status had a huge effect at Attritions. A little over 50% were singles, having the highest count of the 3 categories.

  2.	From Job Role, Sales Executives had the highest number of employees leaving. 

  3.	Sales Executives and Research Scientists were among the roles of employees who left the company the most. By Department, Research and Development lost about 453 employees                 out of the 711 total Attritions. It is necessary to look into workers satisfaction from the department to determine how well the employees are being treated.

  4.	From this analysis, male employees left the company the most by Gender. 441 male employees left out of the total 711 Attritions.

  5.	Judging by Business Travel, approximately 29% of the employees who left travelled frequently. That is 126 of the total Attritions travelled frequently. This may be a huge factor to       attrition at the Organisation.
     
  6.  About 27.62% (195) out of the 711 Total Attrition reported low Job Satisfactory from the Employee's survey which was taken.
    
  7.  125 of the Total Low Satisfactory Employees fell under the Research and Development Department with Research Scientists Job Role leaving the most.
      
  8.	Further analysis showed that the 41% of the Departing employees have only worked at 1 company. Going deeper with my analysis, it showed that 143 of the 237 total Attritions were at       level 1 (Entry Level) according to their Job Level
     
  10.	worked atleast a year 32.2% (229)
  11.	entry level roles 362 (50.9 %

  12.	Further analysis showed that employees who fell in the age range 'Under 30' i.e between 18 - 29 years of age left the country the most, having about 38.40% (273) from the total

## CONCLUSION.
 
 In the rearms of business, an insightful HR Analysis offers a profound glimpse into the heartbeat of the organization. Through this analysis, we have been able to uncover critical pattens and trends shaping the Rate of Attrition, giving rise to these key takeaways:
  •	Employee welfare should be taken very seriously. Regular surveys should be done, regular feedback and evaluation from employees should 
  
  •	Cultivating Employee Experience. From this Analysis, we found out that most employees who left have either worked in the company for less than a year or were working in an entry         level role before their departure. 
  
  •	Developments and Growth Opportunities. Skills developments programs and opportunities to enhance certain aspect of employee’s professional careers. Regular trainings should be           organised and to those who deserves it, expense paid trips should be considered.   
  
  •	Healthy Work-Life Balance. Promoting a healthy work-life balance is very essential to employee retainment. Reasonable work hours, flexible schedule, remote work option and reduced       over time hours to avoid a culture of overworking and burnout. 
  
  •	Exit Interview Analysis. Conducting thorough exit interviews to understand and determine the reason behind employee departures. This feedback/analysis could be used to identify exit   pattern and take notice of areas that need improvement. 
  
### By Implementing these strategies and fostering a supporting, engaging work environment, Attrition Rate could be significantly reduced ensuring a stable, motivated and loyal workforce that contributes to long-term success.
